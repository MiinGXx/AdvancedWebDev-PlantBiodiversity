                <li><strong>What tasks have you not attempted or not completed?</strong>
                    <p>All tasks have been attempted and completed</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Which parts did you have trouble with?</strong>
                    <p>I faced challenges in implementing the plant image classifier. Optimizing the classifier for performance and integrating it seamlessly with the web application required significant effort and debugging.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What would you like to do better next time?</strong>
                    <p>Next time, I would like to improve the user interface and user experience of the web application. I would also like to explore more advanced machine learning models and techniques to enhance the plant image classifier.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What extension features/extra challenges have you done, or attempted, when creating the site?</strong>
                    <p>I have implemented a plant image classifier using a pre-trained deep learning model. The classifier can identify the plant species from an image uploaded by the user.</p>
